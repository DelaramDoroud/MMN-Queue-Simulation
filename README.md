# MMN Queue Simulation

This project is part of the **Distributed Computing** course and implements and analyzes different queueing models through **Discrete Event Simulation (DES)** with a focus on **M/M/N systems** and their extensions.
---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The goal is to move beyond simple M/M/1 models and study more realistic distributed systems.  
The implementation covers:
- **M/M/1 â†’ M/M/N extension**  
- **Supermarket Model optimization** for queue selection  
- **Weibull distribution** for service times (generalization of exponential distribution)  
- **Job priority handling** (priority queues replacing FIFO)  
- **Least Work Left (LWL) model** compared with the supermarket approach
